      <description>Creating the blog Today I was researching in the best and path of least resistance for creating and hosting this blog.
The easy part was hosting; GitHub pages, it&amp;rsquo;s free and provide full flexibility.
I wanted to use Hugo as it allows for very customisable themes (I could create my own in the future). But right now I wanted a quick solution. I could potential use one of them blogging sites like wordpress, but that&amp;rsquo;s boring.</description>

      <title>Returning Negative and Positive Numbers</title>

      <description>Returning Negative and Positive Numbers Abstract Due to the calculations of a piece of work I required to do the following check [Appear Date] &amp;gt;= DateTime.Now.AddDays(-X) where X is the amount of days to add. This determined whether the item supplied should be &amp;lsquo;sticky&amp;rsquo; and therefore at the top of a feed or not.
For Example:
10/01/2019 13:00:00 &amp;gt;= (11/01/2019 14:57:37 - 3 Days) == true; // Sticky 05/01/2019 13:00:00 &amp;gt;= (11/01/2019 14:57:37 - 3 Days) == false; // Not Sticky  However, for readability I wanted X the number of days to be sticky to be a negative number, even if supplied with a positive number.</description>

      <description>First Blog This is my first post.
What it is This is going to be my personal blog update on my day-to-day life as a developer, what features and code I implemented, how I did it and what I learned. As well as any useful sources or information found while developing; focusing mainly on the technical aspects.
Why  I want to. Improves my organisation. Helps me remember.  So here goes Today (10/01/2019) I worked on the Feature Notes Builder.</description>
