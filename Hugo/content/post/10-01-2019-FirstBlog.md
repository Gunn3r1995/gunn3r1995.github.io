# First Blog

This is my first post.

## What it is

This is going to be my personal blog update on my day-to-day life as a developer, what features and code I implemented, how I did it and what I learned. As well as any useful sources or information found while developing; focusing mainly on the technical aspects.

## Why

* I want to.
* Improves my organisation.
* Helps me remember.

## So here goes

Today (10/01/2019) I worked on the Feature Notes Builder. Which interestingly will be what the back-end to present this is based on. It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and my own `Feature Notes Builder` console application to create a organised and useful structure to our release notes.

Additionally we discussed a potential new feature for the Feature Notes Site... Implementing a relationship with the test cases (used by the testing team). This will allow for much better visibility over what has or hasn't been tested, hopefully creating a smoother test process.
