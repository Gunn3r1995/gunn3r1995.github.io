      <description>Creating the blog Today I was researching in the best and path of least resistance for creating and hosting this blog.
The easy part was hosting; GitHub pages, it&amp;rsquo;s free and provide full flexibility.
I wanted to use Hugo as it allows for very customisable themes (I could create my own in the future). But right now I wanted a quick solution. I could potential use one of them blogging sites like wordpress, but that&amp;rsquo;s boring.</description>

      <description>First Blog This is my first post.
What it is This is going to be my personal blog update on my day-to-day life as a developer, what features and code I implemented, how I did it and what I learned. As well as any useful sources or information found while developing; focusing mainly on the technical aspects.
Why  I want to. Improves my organisation. Helps me remember.  So here goes Today (10/01/2019) I worked on the Feature Notes Builder.</description>
